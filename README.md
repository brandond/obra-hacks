OBRA Upgrade Web
=======================

A basic web interface for data scraped from the OBRA website. This repo consolidates code from the obra-upgrade-calculator and obra-upgrade-web repos, as they were effectively only ever used together.

The backend is built on Flask-RESTX in UWSGI.

The frontend is based on simple HTML, Knockout.js for templating, and page.js for navigation.
